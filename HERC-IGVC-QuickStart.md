# HERC-IGVC Quickstart

## Mainnet

As an admin you can simply set the HERC-IGVCs by heading to https://igvc.herc.one
and using MetaMask to registrar. 

As a developer you can interact with the smart contract directly. It is deployed here:

https://etherscan.io/address/#code

Currently, it supports : `hercigvc.eth` 

Etherscan, MetaMask, MyCrypto and MyEtherWallet are available as well. 
Use what ever the hercigvc.eth domain is owned by.
Here's an example of it looks on Etherscan for `anthemgold.hercigvc.eth`
