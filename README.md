# HERC IGVC Subdomain Factory

This project is heavily inspired from the tutorial described in detail and published as part of the corresponding blog article available on [Tenzorum Medium](https://medium.com/tenzorum-project/the-ultimate-ens-and-%C4%91app-tutorial-a4f2ede94b08).

The code has been extended (from the one described in the blog) with support for top level domains other then `.eth` like, for example, `.xyz`.

This project forms the blockchain backend for HERC-IGVC product with the frontend deployed [here](https://igvc.herc.one). 

Quickstart is available here: https://github.com/hercone/herc-igvc-registrar/blob/master/HERCIGVC-QUICKSTART-EN.md
